        <h1 style="text-align: center;">Letâ€™s meet Randy</h1>

<p style="font_size: 30px;">I was born and raised on a farm in southeast Nebraska. After high school, I worked
as a security guard and then for a Farmers Cooperative as branch manager. In
1990, I became a police officer working for Cass County Nebraska and then for
LaVista Nebraska. After 30 years in law enforcement, I retired to start my
counseling service. <br>
<br>
Over the years I have volunteered as an EMT and a trained member of the Critical
Incident Stress Management (CISM) for the State of Nebraska. These years of
helping individuals through difficult situations lead me to my interest in
counseling. <br>
<br>
In 1998, I obtained a Bachelor of Science in Management degree from Bellevue
University. I achieved my Master of Science in Social Work and Master of Science
in Criminology/Criminal Justice in 2020 from University of Nebraska Omaha. I
currently have a provisional license in Mental Health, PLMHP, Master of Social
Work, PLMSW (June 2020) and Alcohol and Drug Counseling, PLADC (May 2021).
Other accomplishments include a published article on elderly suicide, presenting a
webinar for the Nebraska Chapter of National Social Workers Association on Crisis
Intervention and trainer for CISM. I have been asked and have accepted as a
provider for the National Fire Fighters Association and National Fraternal Order of
Police.</p>
